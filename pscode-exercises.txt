// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

X == first number 

Y == second number 

Z == sum

If "x" + "y" then 
Print "z"


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

X == number
If "x" is odd then

Print "odd"


If "x" is even 

Print "even"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 

Read num1,num2,num3,num4,num5  

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

Sum = num1 + num2 +num3 + num4 +num5

Avg = sum/5

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

Smallest number == min

Largest number == max

Set max/min 

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Print avg "average of 5 number"


Print min "minimum"

Print max "maximum"
